## III. PCG (Procedural Content Generation)
**Highlights**
+ Utilized the PCG Node Graph to create procedural buildings and biomes, streamlining content generation.
+ Collaborated closely with artists to develop custom PCG nodes using Blueprints, tailoring tools to meet specific artistic requirements.
**Challenges**
+ The PCG system was still under development, which limited the availability of certain nodes needed for specific environments.
  + To address this, I collaborated with artists to understand their vision and environmental requirements, ensuring alignment with project goals.
  + Despite the initial complexity of the PCG system, I gained a solid understanding of how it generates assets and integrates scene information, which enabled smooth and effective development.
