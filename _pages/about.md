Hi, my name is Chengyan Tsai. I am a dedicated game developer with a strong passion for VFX, computer graphics, gameplay programming, and drawing. I am currently pursuing a Master of Computer Science at Texas A&M University, where I have further developed my skills in C/C++, Python, and Unreal Engine. 

I began my game dev journey as an undergraduate at National Tsing Hua University. I co-founded the NTHU Game Developer Club, organizing workshops and industry lectures for over 300 members. I also served as a lecturer for the NTHU ACG Club, delivering workshops on gesture drawing and color theory.

My long-term career goal is to become a senior game programmer or technical artist, crafting engaging and immersive virtual worlds.
