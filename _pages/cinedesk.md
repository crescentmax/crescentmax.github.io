**CineDesk** is an ongoing project that serves as a virtual production tool for rapid pre-visualization in collaborative environments. Designers and animators can use this interface to effortlessly **plan the staging**, **improve the layout**, and **generate storyboard**. 

The system supports **two input methods** simultaneously: direct touch interaction from the touchscreen and 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (6DoF) navigation using a ***Spacemouse***.

By combining intuitive controls with flexible visualization capabilities, CineDesk aims to streamline the pre-viz process, reduce iteration time, and enhance creative collaboration across teams.

## Tangible Object Input
In addition to touchscreen interaction, CineDesk integrates a tangible input device â€” the ***Spacemouse***. With its 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (6DoF) sensor, users can intuitively and precisely manipulate actors and cameras within the scene. 

Much like a joystick, the Spacemouse enables smooth translation, rotation, and navigation, allowing designers to adjust staging and spatial relationships with a high degree of control and immediacy.
